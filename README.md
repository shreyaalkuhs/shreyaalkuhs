- 👋 Hi, I’m Shreya Shukla, currently a graduate student in theoretical particle physics at University of California, Irvine. I am interested in model-building in both particle physics and machine learning applications. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning techniques in data analysis, as well as exploring applications of geometry in complexity theory and ML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on openAI machine learning projects.
